# Web Dev & Databases Final Project

I chose to create a web planner as my final project. The project consists of a login page, 
a registration page, and a planner page. It auto-populates dates and allows users to 
add events to certain dates. Events can be marked private or public. Private events are 
restricted to viewing by the user who created the event. Public events are viewable by 
all users of the planner.

Database concepts were applied. See FinalProject.pdf for schema, ER diagram, and explanation.
