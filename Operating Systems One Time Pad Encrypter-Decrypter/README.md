# Operating Systems One-Time-Pad Assignment

This was the last assignment from Operating systems. The goal was to
create five small programs that encrypt and decrypt information using 
a one-time-pad-like system. The code uses socket-based inter-process 
communication and performs a handshake to verify a connection. To test,
a grading script was provided to us which encrypted some simple text
from given files and then decrypted the text.
