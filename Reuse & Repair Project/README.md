	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have fun, but don't go too crazy!

Our mobile application has not been built into a standalone app. To view the app, follow these steps:
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. On your phone, download Ionic View from Apple App Store or Google Play.
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Once Ionic View is installed, log in or create an account.
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. In the settings menu select 'Preview App', enter ID: A2578AFF.
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Make sure location settings are on in order for distance display to work correctly.
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Enjoy!
